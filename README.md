# Developing an XGBoost model on a Jupyter notebook and deploying to Algorithmia

This repository is to demonstrate
- Creating an Algorithmia algorithm within a Jupyter notebook
- Building an XGBoost model
- Uploading the saved model file to Algorithmia
- Calling this algorithm to serve your model on Algorithmia
- Happily start serving your model without your deployment concerns!


Check out the built product at https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/asli/xgboost_basic_sentiment_analysis and see this in action.
